## Problem Statement
Procoder Bharath needs to count the number of registrations for his college fest. He's too busy for something so trivial and so he asks his juniors for help. Help him determine the fastest candidate for the job. Build a website similar to this which would test a user's counting speed. Be creative!

## Normal Mode
Arrange layers of numbers randomly in a square grid and allow a user to count by tapping on the numbers in ascending order
Time the user and display their score in seconds
Store the 5 best times using LocalStorage and display them.
## Hacker Mode
Implement different difficulty modes with different number of layers in the grid and display high scores based on difficulty.
Make the website responsive and mobile friendly using CSS Media Queries.
Pick any colour and vary the shades of the tiles in order of the number on them. For example, 1 would be the lightest and 40 would be the darkest.
Add sound effects to the game
## Hacker Mode+++++++
Something about a grid irks Bharath. Free the Forty Shades by looping the rows like a conveyer belt. (Like this)
